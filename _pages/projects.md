The Intelligent Flight Lab works with UAVs and swarms of UAVs. 
We develop, and demonstrate, smart behaviours onboard UAVs.

For this purpose, multiple tools have been developed.
> Virtual environments (Unity3D) to test and improve our autonomy software.
> External motion capture which we adapted to inject real items into Unity3D in real-time.
> A custom-made monitoring solution for real drones to react to the virtual environment.
> Our custom flight arena to perform real-life demonstrations of our progress.
> A custom-made monitoring solution for a real drone fleet to fly reliably during choreographies.

<h3>INDOOR FLIGHT</h3>
<!-- <h3>The drones can be launched from a companion computer. Drones can calculate their position using an optic flow deck. </h3> -->

<h3>DESIGNING CUSTOM TRAJECTORIES</h3>
<!-- <h3>The drone can follow trajectories. Trajectories can be both pre-programmed and streamed.</h3> -->

<h3>ADD YOUR OWN INPUTS FOR DRONE FLIGHT</h3>
<!-- <h3>Previous projects have used hand control and even an OpenBCI Brain Interface for piloting the drone.</h3> -->
