<h2>The Intelligent Flight Lab develops intelligent functionality for robotic systems. We operate in the De Vinci Innovation Center (Paris, France).</h2>

- Providing our demoes online and in real life, as well as meeting with prospective collaborators.
- Developing with the help of our workspace (simulators, validation testing, etc).

<!-- <h1>How does it work?</h1>
<h3>Our robots are localized with sub-millimetre level precision. To achieve this, the drone arena is fitted with a system of infrared cameras. The drone can be flown according to this information and executes figures in a tight latency loop of 28 ms. </h3> -->
